TI  - Phenotype-genotype relationships in PEX10-deficient peroxisome biogenesis 
      disorder patients.
PG  - 509-21
AB  - The peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBD) are characterized by neural, hepatic, 
      and renal deficiencies, severe mental retardation, and are often lethal. These 
      disorders are genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous and are caused by 
      defective peroxisomal protein import and decreased peroxisomal metabolic 
      function. Mutations in PEX10 have been identified in patients from 
      complementation group 7 (CG7) of the PBDs and we report here an analysis of the 
      genotypes and phenotypes of PEX10-deficient patients. All four PEX10-deficient 
      Zellweger Syndrome (ZS) patients were found to have nonsense, frameshift, or 
      splice site mutations that remove large portions of the PEX10 coding region. In 
      contrast, a more mildly affected PEX10-deficient neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy 
      patient expressed a PEX10 allele with a missense mutation, H290Q, affecting the 
      C-terminal zinc-binding domain of the PEX10 product. These results support the 
      hypothesis that severe, loss-of-function mutations in PEX genes cause more severe 
      clinical phenotypes, whereas mildly affected PBD patients have PEX gene mutations 
      that retain residual function. To quantitate the effects of the PEX10 mutations 
      identified here and elsewhere we employed a functional complementation assay. 
      Surprisingly, we observed that nonsense and frameshift mutations predicted to 
      delete the C-terminal 2/3 (R125X) or 1/3 (c.704insA) of the protein displayed 
      nearly normal PEX10 activity. Even more surprising, we found that the 
      unexpectedly high PEX10 activity displayed by these cDNAs could be eliminated by 
      removing or mutating segments of the PEX10 cDNA downstream of the mutations. 
      Although these results demonstrate serious flaws in the PEX10 functional 
      complementation assay, they do suggest that the C-terminal zinc-binding domain is 
      critical for PEX10 function.
