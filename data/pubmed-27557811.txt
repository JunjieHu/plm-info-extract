TI  - Novel PEX3 Gene Mutations Resulting in a Moderate Zellweger Spectrum Disorder.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) may have a variable clinical 
      expression, ranging from severe, lethal to mild phenotypes with progressive 
      evolution. PBDs are autosomal recessive disorders caused by mutations in PEX 
      genes, which encode proteins called peroxins, involved in the assembly of the 
      peroxisome. Patient Description: We herein report a patient who is currently 
      9Â years old and who is compound heterozygous for two novel mutations in the PEX3 
      gene. RESULTS: Mild biochemical abnormalities of the peroxisomal parameters 
      suggested a Zellweger spectrum defect in the patient. Sequence analysis of the 
      PEX3 gene identified two novel heterozygous, pathogenic mutations. CONCLUSION: 
      Mutations in PEX3 usually result in a severe, early lethal phenotype. We report a 
      patient compound heterozygous for two novel mutations in the PEX3 gene, who is 
      less affected than previously reported patients with a defect in the PEX3 gene. 
      Our findings indicate that PEX3 defects may cause a disease spectrum similar as 
      previously observed for other PEX gene defects.
