TI  - PEX26 gene genotype-phenotype correlation in neonates with Zellweger syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Zellweger syndrome (ZS) is commonly manifested as facial deformities, 
      hypotonia, and liver dysfunction. However, ZS caused by PEX26 gene mutation shows 
      a broad and dispersed clinical pattern. In this study, the PEX26 gene in ZS was 
      analyzed to enrich its clinical characteristics. Meanwhile, phenotypic and 
      genotypic characteristics of Zellweger spectrum disorder (ZSD) induced by PEX26 
      mutation were evaluated. METHODS: The clinical data of newborn with ZS in our 
      hospital were analyzed retrospectively. We performed WES and found that the 
      infant carried the PEX26 gene variant. We searched the biomedical literature 
      databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE) to compare clinical features and 
      genotypes. RESULTS: The neonate developed facial deformities, hypotonia, feeding 
      difficulties, and seizures. Her homozygous variant was found in the PEX26 gene 
      (NM_017929: exon2: c.34del) inherited from both parents. Electronic databases, 
      including our case, reported 32 pathogenic variants in PEX26. We found that 
      variation c.292C> T accounted for the largest proportion of PEX26 mutations 
      (16/66, 24.24%). The proportion of deleterious mutations in ZS patients was 
      significantly higher than that in NALD and IRD patients. CONCLUSIONS: We 
      identified pathogenic variations in the PEX26 gene and expanded the known mutant 
      spectrum. By comparing patients with PEX26 mutations, the study determined that a 
      significantly higher percentage of deleterious mutations in ZS was associated 
      with severe clinical phenotypic characteristics.
