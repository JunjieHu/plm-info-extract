TI  - Zellweger Spectrum Disorder with Mild Phenotype Caused by PEX2 Gene Mutations.

AB  - The Zellweger spectrum disorders (ZSDs) are known to be severe disorders with 
      onset in the newborn period or later in childhood, frequently resulting in death 
      during childhood or adolescence. Here, we report a case of ZSD due to mutations 
      in the PEX2 gene, with very mild phenotype. A 51-year-old Italian man was 
      referred to us because of a clinical picture characterized by ataxia, areflexia, 
      nystagmus, and strabismus, with childhood onset and slowly progressive course. 
      The patient showed no cognitive impairment. Neurological examination revealed 
      gait ataxia, dysarthria, dysmetria, areflexia, and bilateral pes cavus. Nerve 
      conduction studies indicated a severe axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Brain 
      MRI showed marked cerebellar atrophy and absence of white matter involvement. MR 
      spectroscopy uncovered a decreased N-acetyl aspartate peak. Biochemical analyses 
      suggested a mild peroxisomal defect. Sequence analysis of the PEX2 gene 
      identified two heterozygous mutations. The clinical phenotype of our patient 
      differs from previously reported ZSD patients with PEX2 gene mutations and 
      suggests that genetic screening of PEX2 is warranted in children and adults with 
      otherwise unexplained autosomal recessive ataxia. MRI findings diverged from the 
      "classic" spectrum observed in ZSDs. The moderate impairment in peroxisome 
      biogenesis seems to affect predominantly neuronal cells in cerebellum, leading to 
      cerebellar atrophy.
