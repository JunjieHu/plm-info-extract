AB  - BACKGROUND: Peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBD) are a heterogeneous group of 
      autosomal recessive disorders that affect multiple organ systems. Approximately 
      80% of PBD patients are classifiedin the Zellweger syndrome spectrum, which is 
      generally caused by mutations in the PEX1, PEX6, PEX10, PEX12, or PEX26 genes. 
      METHODS: We present the clinical characteristics of three male members with 
      cholestatic hepatopathy and developmental delay. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) 
      was used to analyze 52 genes responsible for hereditary diseases with 
      cholestasis. The variant was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Dried blood spot 
      (DBS) samples of 537 newborns from Dagestan were tested for the presence of that 
      mutation. The frequency of the mutant allele in the population of Dagestan 
      wasestimated using the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. RESULTS: Symptoms of disease 
      manifested from the first months of life as severe hepatic dysfunction and 
      developmental delay. Physical examination showed jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, 
      coagulopathy, and normal or slightly elevated level of gamma-glutamyltransferase 
      (GGT), similar to progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis. The level of C26 
      and ratio of C26/C22 in plasma were increased. A nucleotide variant in the PEX26 
      gene was identified: NM_017929.6:c.347 T>A, p.(Leu116Gln) in a homozygous state. 
      Parents and healthy siblings were heterozygous for the mutant allele. This 
      variant was not described in the Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphism 
      (dbSNP), it is not registered in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) v. 
      2020.1. The frequency of the mutant allele in the population of Dagestan is 
      estimated to be less than 0.000931 (99% CI, 0.000929-0.000934). CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      clinical cases from Dagestan describe the phenotype associated with the 
      c.347 T>A,p.(Leu116Gln), variant in the PEX26 gene. We show that the onset of the 
      clinical picture in patients with Zellweger syndrome spectrum could start with 
      severe hepatic dysfunction and cholestasis. We suggest that biochemical screening 
      of PBD in infants with cholestasis is necessary.
