The Zellweger spectrum disorders (ZSDs) are known to be severe disorders with onset in the newborn period or later in childhood, frequently resulting in death during childhood or adolescence. Here, we report a case of ZSD due to mutations in the PEX2 gene, with very mild phenotype. A 51-year-old Italian man was referred to us because of a clinical picture characterized by ataxia, areflexia, nystagmus, and strabismus, with childhood onset and slowly progressive course. The patient showed no cognitive impairment. Neurological examination revealed gait ataxia, dysarthria, dysmetria, areflexia, and bilateral pes cavus. Nerve conduction studies indicated a severe axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Brain MRI showed marked cerebellar atrophy and absence of white matter involvement. MR spectroscopy uncovered a decreased N-acetyl aspartate peak. Biochemical analyses suggested a mild peroxisomal defect. Sequence analysis of the PEX2 gene identified two heterozygous mutations. The clinical phenotype of our patient differs from previously reported ZSD patients with PEX2 gene mutations and suggests that genetic screening of PEX2 is warranted in children and adults with otherwise unexplained autosomal recessive ataxia. MRI findings diverged from the "classic" spectrum observed in ZSDs. The moderate impairment in peroxisome biogenesis seems to affect predominantly neuronal cells in cerebellum, leading to cerebellar atrophy.
